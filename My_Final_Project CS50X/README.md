Introduction
```



This is my personal website that I created using HTML and CSS and some other resources.
I created this website to showcase my skills, interests, and projects. I used HTML and CSS to design and code the website from scratch. 
I also used YouTube and some other websites to find images and icons that suit the theme and style of my website.

The purpose of my website is to present myself as a professional and passionate individual who has a lot to offer in the field of web development. 
My goals are to:

- Demonstrate my proficiency in HTML and CSS
- Highlight my achievements and experiences
- Share my hobbies and passions
- Connect with potential employers and clients

Design and Development Process
```

I followed a design and development process that consisted of the following steps:

- Planning: I defined the scope, objectives, and target audience of my website. I also created a sitemap and a wireframe to outline the structure 
  and layout of my website.
- Designing: I chose a color scheme, a font family, and a logo for my website. I also designed the navigation, the header, the footer, and the 
  content sections of my website using CSS.
- Coding: I wrote the HTML code for each page of my website, following the web standards and best practices. I also used CSS to style and position
  the elements on each page, making sure they are responsive and accessible.
- Testing: I tested my website on different browsers, devices, and screen sizes. I also checked the validity, performance, and usability of my 
  website using various tools and feedback.
- Launching: I uploaded my website files to a web server and registered a domain name for my website. I also promoted my website on social media
  and other platforms.

```python

- You can easily browse the website using the navigation menu at the top of each page.

- You can click on any link on the home page to go to my social media site.
